Seat Booking Logic

Seats have three states:

Available – free to lock

Locked – temporarily held (1-minute timeout for testing)

Booked – permanently reserved

Rules

Only one user can lock a seat at a time

Only the locker can book the seat

Locks automatically expire

Other users see locked seats as unavailable

Payment Simulation

Booking randomly fails to simulate real payment flow

On failure, the seat remains locked

On success, the seat is booked

Multi-User Behavior

Green → Available

Orange → Locked by you

Grey → Locked by another user

Red → Booked

Run Locally

Backend:
uvicorn main:app --reload

Frontend:
npm install
npm start

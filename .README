# Seat Booking System

A full-stack seat booking application built with FastAPI and React, designed to demonstrate secure authentication, backend seat-locking logic, and concurrent booking behavior.

## Overview
The system simulates real-world seat booking workflows where multiple users interact with the same resources. Temporary seat locking is implemented at the backend to prevent double bookings and handle concurrent access safely.

## Tech Stack

**Backend**
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy
- JWT-based authentication
- SQLite (for demo purposes)
- Deployed on Render

**Frontend**
- React
- Fetch API
- Deployed on Vercel

## Authentication
- User signup and login using JWT
- Passwords securely hashed with bcrypt
- Protected seat-related APIs
- Authentication token stored client-side for session handling

## Seat Booking Logic

Each seat can be in one of the following states:
- **Available** – free to be locked
- **Locked** – temporarily held by a user (1-minute timeout for testing)
- **Booked** – permanently reserved

### Rules
- Only one user can lock a seat at a time
- Only the user who locked a seat can book it
- Locks automatically expire after a timeout
- Locked seats are visible to other users as unavailable

## Payment Simulation
- Booking randomly fails to simulate real-world payment behavior
- On failure, the seat remains locked
- On success, the seat is marked as booked

## Multi-User Behavior (UI Indicators)
- **Green** → Available
- **Orange** → Locked by current user
- **Grey** → Locked by another user
- **Red** → Booked

## Live Demo
- Frontend: https://seat-booking-system-omega.vercel.app/
- Backend API: https://seat-booking-backend-9sam.onrender.com

> ⚠️ Note: The backend runs on Render’s free tier and may take a few seconds to respond on the first request due to cold starts.

##  Run Locally

**Backend**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

Frontend

npm install
npm start

## Design Notes

Seat locking is handled at the backend to avoid race conditions during concurrent booking attempts

JWT authentication is used to secure access to protected endpoints

SQLite is used for simplicity. The design supports migration to a persistent database such as PostgreSQL
